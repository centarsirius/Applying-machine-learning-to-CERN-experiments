# Goal
The goal is to design prediction model that will give best score (ROC AUC) and will meet the constraints of

- similar performance on simulated and real data (agreement check)
- decorrelation with the mass (correlation check)

**In other words, the goal is to develop an algorithm for searching for rare decay that should never happen according to the Standard Model.**
