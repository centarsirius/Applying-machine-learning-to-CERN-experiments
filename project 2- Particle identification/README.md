In this project I shall train a classifier to identify type of a particle. There are six particle types: electron, proton, muon, kaon, pion and ghost. Ghost is a particle with other type than the first five or a detector noise. Different particle types remain different responses in the detector systems or subdetectors. Thre are five systems: tracking system, ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH), electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and muon system. Particle type can be identified using the responses in the detector systems.

I have uploaded the training and test data files here : http://www.mediafire.com/folder/spbmzd1ygdnoy/LHC_data as they are too heavy to upload on github. Download them as these are essential to proceed with this project.
