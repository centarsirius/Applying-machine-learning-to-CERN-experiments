# Applying-machine-learning-to-CERN-experiments

Here I have done a chain of mini-projects to infer from the data that was generated by CERN openlab and is easily available online. I have used several machine learning algorithms depending upon the type of data and the type of inference we want to make.

Each of the project has been explained with a seperate readme and the proper visualization and everything is done the jupyter notebooks to understand the essence of what needs to be done.
